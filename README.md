# How-Technical-solutions-can-be-compared

There are many ways to compare technical solutions to problems that occur during projects or development, these problems can span over a  very wide range of things and as of such there are many solutions that need to be looked at in order to solve a problem. In order to find the right solution, there must be a way to compare them to see which one will be the best at solving the problem at hand. One of the ways they can do this is through Effective analysis.

Technical solutions are compared in order to find out what solutions will be best suited for it's purpose, for example a solution that requires a solution for speed will be compared in order to see which one is the fastest. As well as this they also have to be compared against system and user requirements to make sure they are compatible with them, doing this allows the solutions to be compared and prioritised into most effective and least effective when viewed with other solutions.

### What is effective analysis

Effective analysis is where a problem is used as a starting point to have teams look into solutions based on many different factors, these factors include time, cost, security and reliabilty as well as many more.  The qualities of the solution are split into non-functional and functional, non-funtional qualities will include maintainability and safety whereas functional qualities will derive from the systems purpose. The solution will only be offered based on the products functions as it will mean that the solutions will be more effective.

All of these solutions are devised in order for them all to be compared by a team like system engineers in order to compare each individual solutions based on it's given effectiveness on the system that is being fixed. After looking at the different solutions and the effectiveness of the solution as well as the cost and time to implement, the team will decide upon a given solution and they will continue to implement it.
